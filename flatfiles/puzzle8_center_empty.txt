"""
For a game with 8 tiles of blocks on a 3x3 grid,
write down the Facts and Rules to model the game state 
shown as the follows:

 y\\x   pos1     pos2     pos3
     ----------------------------
pos1 | tile1  | tile2  | tile3  |
     ----------------------------
pos2 | tile8  | empty  | tile4  |
     ----------------------------
pos3 | tile7  | tile6  | tile5  |

Example: 
fact: (pred obj1 obj2)
rule: ((pred obj1 obj2) (pred obj2 obj3)) -> (pred obj1 obj3)
